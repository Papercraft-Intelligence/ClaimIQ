## Current performance issues
  - 428ms on cold start
  - 79ms under no load
  - 76m sunder no load
  - 141ms -> 1006ms under load

  Let's see what what can do...

## Why redis is slow in a lambda design
- 400ms+ cold start
- ~75ms warm requests (probably mostly network overhead)
- 100ms - 1000ms under load ðŸ˜°

Redis is crazy fast but the lambda overhead (cold start) + vpc + tcp is just orders of magnitude slower.

## Possible optimizations
  - Cache at cloudfront edge???
    - could be insanely fast??
    - not sure it's even possible??
    - probably complex and annoying to manage
  - Hybrid caching
    - probably the biggest ROI
    - Client -> Memory Cache -> Redis
  - Use an always-on dynamodb??
    - always on (no cold start)
    - probably fast enough to achive < 10ms target
    - no vpc overhead
  - Provisioned Concurrency
    - Keep the feature flag lambda warm 24/7
    - might see some improvement on initial calls
  - Minimize payload
    - reduce serialization overhead
    - return simple boolean instead of full json object?
  - Networking Optimization
    - disable ssl in vpc
    - lambda and redis reside in secure vpc
  - connection pooling
    - reuse connections across requests
    - optimizes within test parameters
    - probably no real-world benefit

    Issues with lambda
      - cold start kills and performance gains
      - hottest of hot cache behinds can't make up for that
      - options:
        - keep lambda warm forever (expensive)
        - don't use lambda for caching

Picture right now

1. Lambda Cold Start:           200ms
2. VPC Network Setup:          50-100ms  
3. Redis Connection:           50-100ms
4. SSL Handshake:              20-50ms
5. Authentication:             10-20ms
6. Actual Redis Query:         0.1ms âš¡ (finally fast!)
7. Connection Teardown:        10-20ms
TOTAL: 340-490ms for first request
